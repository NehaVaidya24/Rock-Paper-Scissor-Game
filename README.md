The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple web-based application where a player can compete against the computer in the classic hand game. The player chooses one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its own option. The winner is determined by the basic rules of the game:

Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
